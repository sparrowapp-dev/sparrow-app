# Contributing to Sparrow App

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[features requests](#features) and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

4. Create a new issue of type bug report.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

<a name="pull-requests"></a>

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

1. Always create a new branch from the **feature** branch that is related to the issue/feature/docs you are starting your work on. If not sure ask for the feature branch by making a comment on the respective ticket. Make sure to follow the branch naming conventions explained below.

2. Name your PR's using Conventional Commits e.g. "fix: ..." or "feat: ..." . More details stated below.

3. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed. Add only relevant files to the commit and ignore the rest to keep the repo clean.

4. Update the readme file with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.

5. You should request review from the [maintainers](https://github.com/sparrowapp-dev/sparrow-app#installation) once you submit the Pull Request.

## Instructions

- Git Workflow (all the commands are to run in your console)

#### Step 1

Fork the repository to your GitHub account

```bash

# Clone the repo

	git  clone  https://github.com/<User-Name>/sparrow-app.git

# Move inside the folder

	cd  sparrow-app

# Add upstream remote

	git  remote  add  upstream  https://github.com/sparrowapp-dev/sparrow-app.git

```

#### Step 2

[Setup project locally](https://github.com/sparrowapp-dev/sparrow-app#installation)

#### Step 3

Create a new branch from the corresponding **feature** branch that will be mentioned in the issue as a tag, in the below format,

```
git checkout -b <commit-type>/[<issue-number>]/{<change-title>}
example - "feat/496/add-indent"
```

Point to note:-
You will get the feature branch tagged in the issue itself.

#### Step 4

Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```
# Ensure branch

	git  branch

# Fetch and merge with upstream/main

	git  fetch  upstream
	git  merge  upstream/main

# Add untracked files

	git  add  .

# Commit all changes with appropriate commit message and description

	git commit -m "<commit-type>: <your-commit-message>[<issue-number>]"
	example - "feat: add indent and indent-less[496]"

# Push changes to your forked repository

	git push origin feat/<issue-number>/{<change-title>}
	example - "feat/496/add-indent"
```

### Commit message types

Every commit should start with one of the commit message types. You can find the type alongside their usage details below.

```
 feat: A new feature introduced to the codebase.
 fix: A bug fix.
 docs: Documentation changes.
 style: Changes that do not affect the code's functionality (e.g., formatting, white-space corrections).
 refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature, typically related to code restructuring or optimization.
 perf: Changes that improve performance.
 test: Adding or modifying tests.
 build: Changes related to the build system or external dependencies.
 ci: Changes to Continuous Integration (CI) configuration or pipelines.
 chore: Other changes that don't modify the code or documentation (e.g., updating dependencies, version bump).
```

#### Step 5

Create a PR on Github

```
FROM - <type>/<issue-issueNumber>/{<change-title>} branch in your forked repository
TO - main branch in the upstream repository
```

#### Step 6

Add a reviewer to the PR (Any [Maintainer](https://github.com/sparrowapp-dev/sparrow-app#installation)) and yourself as assignee.

#### Step 7

Link Pull Request to appropriate Issue, or Project+Milestone (if no issue created)

### IMPORTANT: Do Not Merge the PR unless specifically asked to by an Admin/Maintainer.

#### Step 8

Delete branch from forked repo

```bash
# Delete branch from forked repo

git  branch  -d <type>/<issue-issueNumber>/{<change-title>}

git  push  --delete  origin <type>/<issue-issueNumber>/{<change-title>}
```

#### Step 9

Fetch and merge with upstream/main

```bash
git  checkout  main

git  pull  upstream

git  push  origin

```
