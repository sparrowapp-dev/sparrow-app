# @sparrow/desktop

## Purpose

The `@sparrow/desktop` package is responsible for delivering the desktop version of the Sparrow app. It builds upon the core Sparrow packages, importing functionality from `@sparrow/workspace`, `@sparrow/teams`, `@sparrow/common`,`@sparrow/library`,`@sparrow/support`, `@sparrow/marketplace`, and others to create a fully-fledged desktop application experience.

## Core Features

- **Desktop-specific Optimizations**: Enhances performance and UI specifically for desktop platforms.
- **Offline Support**: Full offline functionality, allowing users to manage collections, environments, and teams without needing an internet connection.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works effortlessly with other Sparrow packages to ensure a smooth and cohesive user experience across different parts of the app.

## Design Considerations

- **Native Feel**: The desktop app is designed to deliver a native-like experience by utilizing frameworks like Tauri, providing users with an intuitive and familiar interface.
- **Offline Capability**: Prioritizes offline functionality to allow users to work without internet access and sync their data when connectivity is restored.

## Usage

After installation, you can import and start using the package within your Tauri or desktop app setup:

```
import { initializeDesktopApp } from '@sparrow/desktop';

initializeDesktopApp({
  // Your app initialization configuration
});
```
