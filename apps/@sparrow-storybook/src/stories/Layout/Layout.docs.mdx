# Layout

A layout organizes content on the screen, ensuring consistency, clarity, and a balanced user interface.

## Responsive Grid Layout

A responsive grid layout ensures a consistent and scalable structure for organizing content across multiple devices and screen sizes. It uses columns, gutters, and margins to create a harmonious and predictable design system.

- **Columns**: Columns are the building blocks of the grid system.

  - **Behavior**: Columns adjust their width dynamically based on screen size.

- **Gutters**: Gutters are the spaces between columns. They ensure content doesn't feel cramped:

  - Mobile: 16px
  - Tablet/Desktop: 24px

- **Margins**: Margins create padding around the layout to keep content visually separate from the screen edges.
  - Small: 16px
  - Large: 32px

## Layout Regions

Our application's interface is divided into three key regions:

**Top Bar**: A dedicated area that serves as a global navigation and provides utility actions.

**Navigation Bar**: This section contains the primary navigation elements, enabling users to access different modules within the application.

**Body**: The main workspace area where users perform their primary interactions with the application.

## Body Region

The Body Region serves as the primary content area for displaying core UI comp1nts, information, and interactions. It utilizes a consistent layout grid to ensure alignment, responsiveness, and visual hierarchy across different screen sizes.

## Responsive Grid Layout for Body Region

The Body Region follows a `stretch` layout grid system, ensuring adaptability for various screen sizes.
