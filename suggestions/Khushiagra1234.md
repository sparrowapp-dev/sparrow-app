### ðŸ’¡ 3 Backend Improvements  

1. **Add Caching for Faster Responses**  
   - *Problem:* The app keeps fetching the same data from the database repeatedly.  
   - *Fix:* Use Redis to store frequently accessed data like user profiles for 1 hour.  
   - *Files to change:* `server/api/users.js`, add new `cache.js` config file.  

2. **Better Error Handling**  
   - *Problem:* Some API errors return confusing messages.  
   - *Fix:* Create standard error formats with helpful messages.  
   - *Files to change:* `server/middlewares/errorHandler.js`.  

3. **Optimize Database Queries**  
   - *Problem:* Some pages load slowly because of heavy database queries.  
   - *Fix:* Add indexes to frequently searched fields and optimize JOIN queries.  
   - *Files to change:* Database migration files.
